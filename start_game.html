            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>This game project began with a simple conversation between two students. We realized that most games nowadays didn’t truly appeal to us—they either lacked visual quality, were too grindy, or overly pay-to-win. So we thought: if we can’t find a game we enjoy, why not create one ourselves?

We understood that game development isn't easy, especially in 3D. So we decided to start with something more manageable: a 2D platformer. As international students, we also saw this as a meaningful opportunity to build something impressive for our future college applications.

At first, it was just the two of us—one focused on game design, and the other on programming. Despite having no prior experience, we dove into learning Unity: building 2D mechanics, designing levels, setting up physics and collisions, and creating character animations.

As the project grew, so did our vision. We transformed our small team into an actual club. Although recruitment was challenging, we managed to bring in members for music composition and level design. Most importantly, we were joined by a senior student who is applying to game design programs. Because she was building her own portfolio in the same field, she had a strong understanding of what colleges and the industry look for. She offered us clear guidance and standards—what must be included, what details shouldn't be overlooked, and how to align our work with professional expectations.

This website was created to document our journey, connect with potential collaborators, and showcase our progress. While many assets and mechanics are still under development, we are continuously learning and pushing the project forward step by step.</p>
